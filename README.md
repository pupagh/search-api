# DEPRECATED

# Xrch

Xrch is a simple alternative to DuckDuckGo. If the `main.py` file isn't working, try removing `debug=True` near the end of the file. You can find more information [here](https://w.xrch.rf.gd/about).

## How-to self host

All that you have to do is clone this git repo, and setup main.py to run on startup. Some information for your server like an IP address will be shown to the public.
